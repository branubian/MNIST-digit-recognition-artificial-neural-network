# MNIST digit recognition artificial neural network

Artificial neural network built from scratch without using pytorch, keras or other machine learning libraries

Contains two neural networks built directly from scratch, both trained on the MNIST dataset.

User can customize and decide the number of neurons in each hidden layer of both a single layer neural network and a multi layer neural network.

For training and testing accuracy measurement purposes, it is recommended to train on 2000 to 5000 training samples with about 1000 epochs and a learning rate of 0.1 for backpropagation.
