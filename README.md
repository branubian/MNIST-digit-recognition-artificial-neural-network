# MNIST digit recognition artificial neural network from scratch

Artificial neural network built from scratch without using pytorch, keras or other machine learning libraries to better gain comprehension of the math behind machine learning.

Contains three different trainable & testable neural network architectures, trained on the MNIST dataset.

For training and testing accuracy measurement, it is recommended to train with the parameters given in parenthesis.

Run "MNIST 784xn1xn2x10.py" and input the desired training parameters to return accuracy on testing samples, same with the other file.

Program slices the MNIST training dataset in "train.csv" into a batch for training and a batch for testing.
